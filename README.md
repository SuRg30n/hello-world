    "ty world for reading this terrible beginning description"
    on a side note, i love fast cars, rally cars to be specific, own a modified fiesta st, and after I start making the large 
    money from developing i fully intend on owning a wrc spec car, and possibly a ferrari.
    Currently have a beautful girlfriend that is the most valuable thing to me in life, i would love to be able to spoil her 
    with a large house and possibly a few children to raise in it.
    Help me with as much information possible.
